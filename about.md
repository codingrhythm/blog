![About Me]({{ site.url }}/images/about-me.jpg)

I am an experienced web and mobile application developer who is passionate about programming and computer technology. I love to make things work by coding.

In most cases, I use Python (Django) or PHP for my web services. Objective C, Flex, HTML(5), Javascript (JQuery) and CSS(3) are my blocks for user interface building. I always try to implement the latest and coolest skills and technologies on new project which means I always learn something new from time to time.

I love Apple products! I am obsessed by the user interface and experiences they bring to me. That's why I would:

1. Spend a whole day to fine tune the user interface
2. Write elegant code
3. Improve everything again and again
4. Try different things again and again

Until I am happy with everything.

I learn things quickly. PHP in one month, Python in one month, Flex in 10 days, Objective-C in two weeks and I cannot even remember how I learned HTML, JS, CSS etc.

Here is a list of projects which I worked completed alone, mostly from design to deliver.

1. [Optimism Online][ref-link-1] (The web version, PHP + Flex, web app for mood management, freelance project)
2. [12income][ref-link-2] (Django + Bootstrap, online accounting app, personal project)
3. [5coins][ref-link-3] (iOS, personal project)
4. [Pneumatech China Website][ref-link-4] (Django, freelance project)
5. [Babybang][ref-link-5] (Django, company project)

- PHP

- MySQL
- Linux (Server setup, configuration and optimize)
- Objective-C
- Photoshop (Web and UI design)
