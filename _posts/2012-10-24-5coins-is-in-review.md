5coins is a simple app for tracking your daily expenses. Unlike other apps available at the store. 5coins only focuses on your daily expenses which means there are no over-weighted features like budgets, multiple accounts, charts/reports etc. I believe simplicity makes life easier!

5coins had been submitted to App Store yesterday for review. Hopefully it will be available for download next week.

I also made a [simple page][5coins-link] for it
