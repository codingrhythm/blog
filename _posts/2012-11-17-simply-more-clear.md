I have just submit 1.2 version for review today. Hopefully you will be able to download next weekend.

What new?

1. The user experiences have been improved. The navigation bar will be automatically hidden when you scroll down the list, so you can see more items in the gained screen size.

2. The expenses list is now separated by days. So it's more clear than the  old version.

There are about 20 purchases since I released the first version. It's not much. But still thanks to all those people. I will try my best to deliver a better expenses track app on the store.
